# Update a class with properties and methods in CSharp

In this exercise, you encapsulate the data and behavior of a class by implementing properties and methods.

This exercise includes the following tasks:

1. Review the existing code
1. Create properties for the ABC class
1. Create automatically implemented properties for the XYZ class
1. Create read-only and write-only properties
1. Create methods for the ABC class
1. Create extension methods for the XYZ class

This exercise should take approximately **30** minutes to complete.

## Before you start

Before you can start this exercise, you will need to...

1. Ensure that you have the latest LTS version of the .NET SDK installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of the .NET SDK from the following URL: [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
1. Ensure that you have Visual Studio Code installed on your computer. You can download Visual Studio Code from the following URL: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
1. Ensure that you have the C# Dev Kit configured in Visual Studio Code.

For addition help configuring the Visual Studio Code environment, see [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/install-configure-visual-studio-code/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/install-configure-visual-studio-code/)
