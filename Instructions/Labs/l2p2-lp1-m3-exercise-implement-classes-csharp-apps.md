# Implement classes in C# applications

In this exercise, you encapsulate the data and behavior of a class by implementing properties and methods.

This exercise includes the following tasks:

1. Review the existing code
1. Split the ABC class into partial classes
1. Create a static class that holds methods for the XYZ class
1. Update methods in the XYZ class using named and optional parameters
1. Implement object initializers and copy constructors

This exercise should take approximately **30** minutes to complete.

## Before you start

Before you can start this exercise, you will need to...

1. Ensure that you have the latest LTS version of the .NET SDK installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of the .NET SDK from the following URL: [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
1. Ensure that you have Visual Studio Code installed on your computer. You can download Visual Studio Code from the following URL: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
1. Ensure that you have the C# Dev Kit configured in Visual Studio Code.

For addition help configuring the Visual Studio Code environment, see [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/install-configure-visual-studio-code/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/install-configure-visual-studio-code/)

## Task 1: Review the existing code

In this task, you open an existing project and review the code.

Use the following steps to complete this section of the exercise:

## Task 2: Split the ABC class into partial classes

In this task, you split the ABC class between two partial classes, moving the methods in a separate file.

Use the following steps to complete this section of the exercise:

1. Open the ABC.cs file.

## Task 3: Create a static class that holds methods for the XYZ class

In this task, you create a static class for the XYZ class methods.

Use the following steps to complete this section of the exercise:

1. Open the XYZ.cs file.

    ```

## Task 5: Implement object initializers and copy constructors

In this task, you update the `Main` method using object initializers and copy constructors.

Use the following steps to complete this section of the exercise:

1. Open the XYZ.cs file.
